                        <p>The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),
                            located near
                            Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence
                            activist Vallabhbhai
                            Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent
                            India and an
                            adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel is highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562
                            princely states of
                            India to form the single Union of India. The statue is located in Gujarat on the Narmada
                            River in the
                            Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the city
                            of Vadodara.</p>
                        <p>The project was first announced in 2010, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian
                            company Larsen &
                            Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹27 billion (US$422 million). It was designed by
                            Indian sculptor
                            Ram V. Sutar and was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, on 31
                            October 2018, the
                            143rd anniversary of Patel's birth.</p><br>
                        <span class="sticky"># History</span><br>
                        <p>Narendra Modi announced the project on 7 October 2013 to mark the beginning of his tenth year
                            as the chief
                            minister of Gujarat.</p>
                        <p>A society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) was formed under the
                            chairmanship of
                            the Chief Minister of Gujarat, to execute the project.</p>
                        <p>Statue of Unity Movement was started in 2013 to collect the iron needed for the statue by
                            asking farmers to
                            donate their used farming instruments. By 2016, a total of 135 metric tonnes of scrap iron
                            had been
                            collected and about 109 tonnes of it was used to make the foundation of the statue after
                            processing. A
                            marathon titled Run For Unity was held on 15 December 2013 in Surat and Vadodara in support
                            of the project.

                        <b style="color: white;">Design</b>
                        <p>After studying statues of Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and
                            academics chose a
                            design submitted by the Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar. The Statue of Unity is a larger
                            version of a statue of
                            the leader installed at Ahmedabad International Airport. Commenting on the design, Ram
                            Sutar's son, Anil
                            Sutar explains that, "the expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron
                            will as well as
                            kindness that his personality exudes. The head is up, a shawl flung from shoulders and hands
                            are on the side
                            as if he is set to walk". Three models of the design measuring 3 feet (0.91 m), 18 feet (5.5
                            m), and 30 feet
                            (9.1 m) were initially created. Once the design of the largest model was approved, a
                            detailed 3D-scan was
                            produced which formed the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a foundry in China.</p>
                        <p>Patel's dhoti-clad legs and the use of sandals for footwear rendered the design thinner at
                            the base than at
                            the top thereby affecting its stability. This was addressed by maintaining a slenderness
                            ratio of 16:19
                            rather than the customary 8:14 ratio of other tall buildings. The statue is built to
                            withstand winds of up
                            to 180 kilometres per hour (110 mph) and earthquakes measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale
                            which are at a depth
                            of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue. This is aided by the use of two 250
                            tonne tuned mass
                            dampers ensuring maximum stability.</p>
                        <p>The total height of the structure is 240 m (790 ft), with a base of 58 m (190 ft) and the
                            statue measuring
                            182 m (597 ft). The height of 182 metres was specifically chosen to match the number of
                            seats in the Gujarat
                            Legislative Assembly.</p>
                        <b style="color: white;">Funding</b>
                        <p>The Statue of Unity was built by a Public Private Partnership model, with most of the money
                            coming from the
                            Government of Gujarat. The Gujarat state government had allotted ₹500 crore (equivalent to
                            ₹641 crore or
                            US$80 million in 2020) for the project in its budget from 2012 to 2015. In the 2014–15 Union
                            Budget, ₹200
                            crore (equivalent to ₹272 crore or US$34 million in 2020) was allocated for the construction
                            of the statue.
                            Funds were also contributed by Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social
                            Responsibility scheme.
                        </p>
                        <b style="color: white;">Construction</b>
                        <p>A consortium comprising Turner Construction, Michael Graves and Associates and the Meinhardt
                            Group supervised
                            the project. The project took 57 months to complete – 15 months for planning, 40 months for
                            construction and
                            2 months for handing over by the consortium. The total cost of the project was estimated to
                            be about ₹2,063
                            crore (equivalent to ₹28 billion or US$350 million in 2020) by the Government. The tender
                            bids for the first
                            phase were invited in October 2013 and were closed in November 2013.</p>
                        <p>Narendra Modi, then serving as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, laid the statue's foundation
                            stone on 31
                            October 2013, the 138th anniversary of Patel's birth.</p>
                        <p>Indian infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro won the contract on 27 October 2014 for its
                            lowest bid of
                            ₹2,989 crore (equivalent to ₹41 billion or US$510 million in 2020) for the design,
                            construction and
                            maintenance of the statue. L&T commenced the construction on 31 October 2014. In the first
                            phase of the
                            project, ₹1,347 crore was earmarked for the main statue, ₹235 crore for the exhibition hall
                            and convention
                            centre, ₹83 crore for the bridge connecting the memorial to the mainland and ₹657 crore for
                            the maintenance
                            of the structure for a duration of 15 years after its completion. The Sadhu Bet hillock was
                            flattened from
                            70 metres to 55 metres to lay the foundation of the statue.</p>
                        <p>L&T employed over 3000 workers and 250 engineers in the statue's construction. The core of
                            the statue used
                            210,000 cubic metres (7,400,000 cu ft) of cement and concrete, 6,500 tonnes of structural
                            steel, and 18,500

                            Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.
                            1628–1658) to house
                            the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
                            The
                            tomb is the

                            is
                            believed to be derived from the Persian تاج محل tāj mahall, meaning "crown" (tāj) "palace"
                            (mahall).The name
                            "Taj"

                        <p>The plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took

                            that forms part of
                            the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded
                            by the Tomar
                            Rajputs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It
                            is one
                            of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and 1220.</p>
                        <p>It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which
                            was constructed
                            a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are
                            elaborately
                            decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is
                            fluted with "superb
                            stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In general, minarets

                        <p>This victory tower is a symbol of the synthesis of traditional Islamic architecture and
                            Southwestern Asian
                            design. Elizabeth Lambourn’s Islam Beyond Empires: Mosques and Islamic Landscapes in India
                            and the Indian
                            Ocean studies the introduction of Islam in South Asia and how the region influenced the
                            Islamic religious
                            architecture. These newly arrived Muslims from the Islamic West escaped the Mongol Empire
                            and emigrated
                            to India, where they constructed religious centers. The Qutb Minar serves as a central
                            marker to these new
                            Muslim communities as well as being a reminder of Islam's presence in the area. The
                            architecture of the
                            minaret varies greatly from that of the typical style and design of the mosques constructed
                            in the Middle
                            East. The style of these structures is heavily influenced by the local architecture such as
                            the Indic
                            temples. This affected the different materials, techniques, and decoration that were used in
                            the
                            construction of the Qutb Minar.</p>
                        <p>The minaret is unique in that historically, these tower minarets were uncommon in South
                            Asian-Islamic design
                            until the 17th century. This lag is due to the slow adoption of the typical Middle Eastern
                            style in
                            India. It is also detached from the main mosque, showcasing how the native culture affected
                            the design
                            of a Middle Eastern structure. The Qutb Minar is seen as the "earliest and best example of a
                            fusion or
                            synthesis of Hindu-Muslim traditions" according to Ved Parkash in his essay The Qutb Minar
                            from Contemporary
                            and Near Contemporary Sources. Like many mosques built in South Asia during this time
                            period, the
                            minaret was constructed by Hindu laborers and craftsmen but overseen by Muslim architects.
                            This led to a
                            construction that synthesized both Hindu and Islamic religious architecture. Since the
                            craftsmen were Hindu
                            and unfamiliar with the Quran, the inscriptions are a compilation of disarranged Quranic
                            texts and other
                            Arabic expressions.</p>

                        <p>The construction of the Qutb Minar was planned and financed by the Ghurids, who emigrated to
                            India and
                            brought Islam with them. The Ghurids, historically known as the Shansabanis, were a clan of
                            Tajik origin
                            that hailed from Ghur, the mountainous region of modern-day western Afghanistan. In the late
                            eleventh
                            century to the early twelfth century, the different sects of this nomadic clan united,
                            losing its nomadic
                            culture. During this time, they also converted to Islam.</p>
                        <p>They then expanded into modern-day India and quickly took control of a substantial part of
                            the country.
                            The Ghurids annexed the Multan and Uch in the western Punjab in 1175-76, the northwestern
                            regions around
                            Peshawar in 1177, and the region of Sindh in 1185-86. In 1193, Qutb al-Din Aibek conquered
                            Delhi and

                        <p>On 14 November 2000, Delhi newspapers reported that the Hindu nationalist groups, Vishva
                            Hindu Parishad and
                            Bajrang Dal, planned to host a yajna, a ritualistic Hindu ceremony related to cleansing or
                            purification, at
                            the Qutub Minar complex where the minaret is located. The Delhi police detained 80 activists
                            led by Ram
                            Krishan Gaur that were located by the Qutb Minar and were stopped from performing the yajna
                            inside the
                            tower. Due to a police barricade, the activists instead performed the ritual on the streets
                            outside the
                            mosque complex. Since the spolia of Jain and Hindu temples were used to construct the
                            minaret, the
                            right-wing Hindu groups believed that they needed to perform a cleansing at the complex in
                            order to free the
                            Hindu icons that were "trapped" in the minaret and the mosque complex.</p>
                        <p>On 18 May 2022, a former Regional Director of Archaeological Survey of India, Dharamveer

                        <p>Rani ki vav was constructed during the rule of the Chaulukya dynasty. It is located on the
                            banks of Saraswati
                            river. Prabandha-Chintamani, composed by the Jain monk Merutunga in 1304, mentions:
                            "Udayamati, the daughter
                            of Naravaraha Khengara, built this novel stepwell at Shripattana (Patan) surpassing the
                            glory of the
                            Sahasralinga Tank". According to it, the stepwell was commissioned in 1063 and was completed
                            after 20 years.
                            It is generally assumed that it was built in the memory of Bhima I (r. c. 1022 – 1064) by
                            his queen
                            Udayamati and probably completed by Udayamati and Karna after his death but whether she was
                            a widow when she
                            commissioned it is disputed. Commissariat puts the date of construction to 1032 based on the
                            architectural
                            similarity to Vimalavasahi temple on Mount Abu built in the same year.</p>
                        <p>The stepwell was later flooded by the Saraswati river and silted over. In 1890s, Henry
                            Cousens and James
                            Burgess visited it when it was completely buried under the earth and only well shaft and few
                            pillars were
                            visible. They described it as being a huge pit measuring 87 metres (285 ft). In Travels in

                            James Tod mentioned that the material from the stepwell was reused in the other stepwell
                            built in modern
                            Patan, probably Trikam Barot ni Vav (Bahadur Singh stepwell). In the 1940s, excavations
                            carried out under
                            the Baroda State revealed the stepwell. In 1986, a major excavation and restoration was

                            Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). An image of Udayamati was also recovered during the

                            ornamented.
                            Kalpavriksha carvings on the wall represent fertility and nature worship while kirtimukhas
                            and makaras adorn
                            the basements and capitals of pillars. There are latticework patterns and designs resembling
                            geometric local

                            Mehsana district, Gujarat, India. It is situated on the bank of the river Pushpavati. It was
                            built after
                            1026-27 CE during the reign of Bhima I of the Annhilwara Chalukya / SOLANKI dynasty. No

                            reservoir. The
                            halls have intricately carved exterior and pillars. The reservoir has steps to reach the

                        <span class="sticky"># History</span><br>
                        <p>The shrine proper of the Sun Temple was built during the reign of Bhima I of Chaulukya
                            dynasty. Earlier,
                            during 1024–1025, Mahmud of Ghazni had invaded Bhima's kingdom, and a force of around 20,000
                            soldiers had
                            unsuccessfully tried to check his advance at Modhera. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes
                            that the Sun Temple
                            might have been built to commemorate this defense. On a block in western wall of cella,
                            there is an
                            inscription "Vikram Samvat 1083" upside down carelessly incised in Devnagari script which
                            correspond to
                            1026-1027 CE. No other date is found. As the inscription is upside down, it evidences the
                            destruction and
                            reconstruction of the cella. Due to the position of the inscription, it is not firmly
                            considered as the date
                            of construction. On the stylistic ground, it is known that the Kunda with its corner shrines
                            was built
                            earlier at the beginning of the 11th century. The inscription is rather considered as the
                            date of
                            destruction by Ghazni instead of the construction. Soon after Bhima had returned to the
                            power. So the temple
                            proper, the miniature and the niche shrines in the tank were built shortly after 1026 CE.
                            The dancing hall
                            was added much later in the third quarter of the 12th century along with the gateways, the
                            porch of the
                            temple proper and the doorframes of the temple and the cella during the reign of the Karna.

                        <p>The temple is built on 23.6° latitude (approximately near Tropic of Cancer).The place was
                            later known as Sita
                            ni Chauri and Ramkund locally. No worship is offered here now. The temple is the Monument of
                            National
                            Importance and is maintained by the Archeological Survey of India.</p>
                        <p>It was added to the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 2022.</p>

                        <p>The temple complex is built in Māru-Gurjara style (Chaulukya style). The temple complex has
                            three axially
                            aligned components; the shrine proper (garbhagriha) in a hall (gudhamandapa), the outer or
                            assembly hall
                            (sabhamandapa or rangamandapa) and a sacred reservoir (kunda).</p>
                        <p>The Sabhamandapa is not in continuation with Gudhamandapa but is placed little away as a
                            separate structure.
                            Both are built on a paved platform. Their roofs have collapsed long ago leaving behind a few
                            lower-most
                            courses. Both roofs are 15' 9" in diameter but are constructed differently. The platform or
                            plinth is
                            inverted lotus-shaped.</p>

                        <p>The Gudhamandapa measures 51 feet 9 inches by 25 feet 8 inches. It is almost equally divided
                            into
                            Gudhamandapa, the hall and Garbhgriha, the shrine proper. Both are rectangular in plan with
                            one projection
                            on each of the smaller sides and two projections on each of the longer sides. These
                            projections on the
                            smaller sides form the entrance and the back of the shrine. The three projections of the
                            outer wall of
                            Gudhamandapa had windows on each side and the east projection had the doorway. These windows
                            had perforated
                            stone screens; the northern is in ruins and the southern is missing. Pradakshinamarga is
                            formed by the
                            passage between the walls of Garbhgriha and the outer walls of Gudhamandapa. The roof of
                            passage has stones
                            slabs carved with rosettes. The Shikhara of it no longer exists.</p>
                        <p>The Garbhagriha, the shrine proper or sanctum sanctorum is square measuring 11 feet from
                            inside.
                            The shrine had two cells; a cell below the level of the upper cell. The floor of the upper
                            cell is now
                            fallen which once housed the image of a deity. The seat of the image is now in a pit. The
                            lower cell was
                            probably used for storage.</p>
                        <p>The walls inside the shrine are plain and the outer wall is decorated. The doorway has carved
                            figures of
                            seated Surya in panels surrounded by dancers and amorous couples. All figures are mutilated
                            and the images
                            on the door-lintel are completely destroyed.</p>
                        <p>The sanctum sanctorum is designed in a way that the first rays of rising sun lit up the image
                            of Surya during
                            solar equinox days and on summer solstice day, the sun shines directly above the temple at

                        <p>The outer walls of the shrine is highly decorated. The base and walls of the shrine and hall
                            are divided into
                            several stretches with unique carvings. the Pitha or adhisthana, the base has the two square
                            members called
                            Bhat followed by a cyma recta carving (lower part convex and upper part concave). It is
                            followed by padma or
                            padmaka, the molding in form of an inverted lotus. The next is antarita, a fillet or an
                            astragal with a
                            sharp edge between two recesses. Above this is patta having thin molding called chhaja at
                            its lower edge.
                            The next is another chhaja separated by neck, alinga. The next broad band, patti, is
                            gajathara carved with

                            wall called
                            jangha exist. These panels are decorated with figures of gods but the figures of Surya are
                            placed
                            prominently than others as the temple is dedicated to him. Other panels are decorated with
                            dancers and other
                            figures.</p>
                        <p>The figures of Surya are prominently carved on three niches of shrine proper as well as on

                        <p>The pitha is almost similar to the Gudhamandapa but smaller as two courses of fillets are
                            omitted. The padma
                            is carved richly here with floral ornamentation.</p>

                            in tiers which has numerous floral girdles. It is 23 feet high. It is supported by pillars
                            arranged in an
                            octagon. These pillars have stilts that support the lintels. Torana or the decorated cusped
                            arches arise
                            from the lower brackets of the pillars and touch the lintels in middle. There are two types;
                            semicircular
                            and triangular. The semicircular arches have cusped arches with tips while triangular arches
                            have a round
                            apex and wavy sides. Both types have a broad band decorated with figures and tips which are
                            now defaced and
                            damaged. The lower brackets has Makara which gives the name of Makara-Torana while
                            decoration gives name of

                        <p>The pillars of Sabhamandapa and Gudhamandapa are of two types; short and tall. The short
                            pillars rest on the
                            walls and support the roof. The tall pillars rise from the floor.</p>
                        <b style="color: white;">Short pillars</b>
                        <p>The shaft is square in shape to half of its height followed by the vase and then followed by
                            an octagonal
                            shaft. It is surmounted by a capital and a bracket. The square part has a floral design in a
                            circle on each
                            side of the face. The vase is decorated similarly on its corners. The octagonal part has
                            four bands; the
                            topmost has kirtimukha. The capital has three annulets.</p>
                        <b style="color: white;">Tall pillars</b>
                        <p>They arise from square or octagonal base, kumbhi, with triangular ornamentation on each face.
                            Above it is
                            kalasha. It is followed by a deep band and the next is kevala decorated with
                            chaitya-windows. the next is

                        <p>The next is the beginning of the shaft. It is first decorated with standing figures, mostly
                            dancers, on all
                            eight faces enclosed in ringed pilasters. The next band with scenes of men and beasts is
                            separated from it
                            by the round pillow-like band. It is followed by a still smaller band with sixteen standing
                            human figures
                            separated by small annulet below. The next is a band of leaves. Then the shaft becomes
                            circular and had
                            three or four bands having a row of male warriors, lozenges, circles and kirtimukha at last.
                            The kirtimukhas
                            are separated by chain and bell ornamentation.</p>
                        <p>It follows capital similar to small pillars crowned with makara brackets if eight stilted
                            pillar and dwarfs
                            in the rests. the eight stilted pillars have one more shaft and similar type of capital
                            which is crowned
                            with brackets of volutes and pendant leaves.</p>

                        <p>The stepwell on the west of Kunda has one entrance and two pavilion-towers. It is moderately
                            ornamented. The
                            door-frame has lotus and leaves and the ruchaka type pilasters indicate it belongs to 11th
                            century. The
                            small mandapa above the ground level and located on the second kuta of stepwell may belong
                            to tenth century.

                        <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India,
                            that historically
                            served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned
                            construction of the Red
                            Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red
                            and white, its
                            design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The
                            fort represents
                            the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture
                            with Indian
                            traditions.</p>
                        <p>The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal
                            Empire in 1739.
                            Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following
                            the Indian
                            Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was
                            subsequently used
                            as a garrison.</p>
                        <p>On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian
                            flag above the
                            Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists
                            the Indian
                            tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its

                        <p>The name Red Fort is a translation of the Hindustani Lāl Qila (Hindi: लाल क़िला, Urdu: لال
                            قلعہ), deriving
                            from its red sandstone walls. Lal was derived from Hindustani language meaning "Red" and
                            Qalàh derived from
                            Arabic word meaning "Fortress". As the residence of the imperial family, the fort was
                            originally known as
                            the "Blessed Fort" (Qila-i-Mubārak).Agra Fort is also known as Lāl Qila.</p><br>

                            capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours its
                            design is credited
                            to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal The fort lies along the
                            Yamuna River,
                            which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred Islamic
                            month of
                            Muharram, on 13 May 1638.Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 6 April 1648. Unlike
                            other Mughal
                            forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh
                            Fort.The
                            fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old
                            Delhi. Shah Jahan's
                            successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private
                            quarters, constructing
                            barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous.
                        </p>
                        <p>The administrative and fiscal structure of the Mughal dynasty declined after Aurangzeb, and
                            the 18th century
                            saw a degeneration of the palace. In 1712 Jahandar Shah became the Mughal Emperor. Within a
                            year of
                            beginning his rule, Shah was murdered and replaced by Farrukhsiyar. In 1739, Persian emperor
                            Nadir Shah
                            easily defeated the strong Mughal army of around 200,000 soldiers, plundering the Red Fort,
                            including the
                            Peacock Throne. Nadir Shah returned to Persia after three months, leaving a destroyed city
                            and a weakened
                            Mughal empire to Muhammad Shah. The internal weakness of the Mughal Empire made the Mughals
                            only titular
                            rulers of Delhi, and a 1752 treaty made the Marathas protectors of the throne at Delhi. The
                            1758 Maratha
                            victory at Sirhind aided by the Sikhs and successive defeat at Panipat placed them in
                            further conflict with
                            Ahmad Shah Durrani.</p>
                        <p>In 1760, the Marathas removed and melted the silver ceiling of the Diwan-i-Khas to raise
                            funds for the
                            defence of Delhi from the armies of Ahmed Shah Durrani. In 1761, after the Marathas lost the
                            third battle of
                            Panipat, Delhi was raided by Ahmed Shah Durrani. Ten years later, the Marathas, acting on
                            the behest and as
                            mercenary of the exiled Emperor Shah Alam, recaptured Delhi from the Rohilla Afghans.
                            Mahadji Scindia, the
                            commander of Maratha army bowed to Mughal Emperor Shah Alam to demonstrate his submission to
                            him. Thus, Shah
                            Alam was restored to the throne.</p>
                        <p>In 1764, the Jat ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Jawahar Singh (the son of Maharaja Suraj Mal)
                            attacked Delhi
                            and captured the Red Fort of Delhi on 5 February 1765. Two days later, after taking tribute
                            from the
                            Mughals, removed their armies from the fort and the Jats took away the throne of the
                            Mughals, called the
                            pride of the Mughals, and the doors of the Red Fort as a memorial, and this throne is today
                            enhancing the
                            beauty of the palaces of Deeg. The doors are located in the Lohagarh Fort of Bharatpur.</p>
                        <p>In 1783 the Sikh Misl Karor Singhia, led by Baghel Singh, conquered Delhi and the Red Fort.
                            Baghel Singh,
                            Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Jassa Singh Ramgarhia all allied with a 40,000 force and looted
                            the area from
                            Awadh to Jodhpur. After negotiations, Baghel Singh and his forces agreed to leave Delhi and
                            reinstate the
                            Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. The condition of their retreat included the construction of
                            seven Sikh
                            Gurdwaras in Delhi, including the Gurudwara Sis Ganj in Chandni Chowk.</p>
                        <p>In 1788, a Maratha garrison occupied the Red Fort and Delhi alongside providing protection to
                            the Mughal
                            Emperor. Mahadji Scindia signed a treaty with the Sikhs where they were warned not to enter
                            Delhi or ask for
                            the Rakhi tribute. The fort came under the control of the East India Company following the
                            Second
                            Anglo-Maratha War in 1803.</p>
                        <p>During the Second Anglo-Maratha War, forces of the East India Company defeated Maratha forces
                            of Daulat Rao
                            Scindia in the Battle of Delhi; this ended Maratha control over the city and their control
                            of the Red Fort.
                            After the battle, the British East India Company took over the administration of Mughal
                            territories and
                            installed a Resident at the Red Fort. The last Mughal emperor to occupy the fort, Bahadur
                            Shah II, became a
                            symbol of the 1857 rebellion against the British East India Company in which the residents
                            of Shahjahanabad
                            participated.</p>
                        <p>Despite its position as the seat of Mughal power and its defensive capabilities, the Red Fort
                            was not a site
                            of an engagement during the 1857 uprising against the British. After the rebellion was
                            defeated, Bahadur
                            Shah II left the fort on 17 September and was apprehended by British forces. Bahadur Shah
                            Zafar II returned
                            to Red Fort as a British prisoner, was tried in 1858 and exiled to Rangoon on 7 October of
                            that year. After
                            the end of the rebellion, the British sacked the Red Fort before ordering its systemic
                            demolition. 80% of
                            the fort’s buildings were demolished as a result of this effort, including the stone screen
                            that connected
                            the pavilions along the fort’s river-facing façade, which was demolished. All furniture was
                            removed or
                            destroyed; the harem apartments, servants' quarters and gardens were demolished, and a line
                            of stone
                            barracks built in their place. Only the marble buildings on the east side at the imperial
                            enclosure escaped
                            complete destruction, although they were damaged by the demolition efforts. While the
                            defensive walls and
                            towers were relatively unharmed, more than two-thirds of the inner structures were
                            demolished.</p>
                        <p>Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, ordered repairs to the fort including
                            reconstruction of the
                            walls and the restoration of the gardens complete with a watering system.</p>
                        <p>Most of the jewels and artwork located in the Red Fort were looted during Nadir Shah's
                            invasion of 1747 and
                            again after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British. They were eventually sold to
                            private
                            collectors or the British Museum, the British Library and the Victoria and Albert Museum.
                            For example, the
                            jade wine cup of Shah Jahan and the crown of Bahadur Shah II are all currently located in
                            London. Various
                            requests for restitution have so far been rejected by the British government.</p>

                            their visit, some
                            buildings were restored. The Red Fort Archaeological Museum was moved from the drum house to
                            the Mumtaz
                            Mahal.</p>
                        <p>The INA trials, also known as the Red Fort Trials, refer to the courts-martial of a number of
                            officers of the
                            Indian National Army. The first was held between November and December 1945 at the Red Fort.

                        <p>On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian

                            the Lahore Gate.</p>
                        <p>After Indian Independence, the site experienced few changes, and the Red Fort continued to be
                            used as a
                            military cantonment. A significant part of the fort remained under Indian Army control until
                            22 December
                            2003, when it was given to the Archaeological Survey of India for restoration. In 2009 the

                            and attracts
                            thousands of visitors every year. It is a monument of national significance; every year on
                            India's
                            Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister of India hoists the country's flag at the

                            delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts. The fort also appears on the back

                            of the Mahatma Gandhi New Series of the Indian rupee.</p>
                        <p>The major architectural features are in mixed condition; the extensive water features are
                            dry. Some buildings
                            are in fairly good condition, with their decorative elements undisturbed; in others, the
                            marble inlaid
                            flowers have been removed by looters. The tea house, although not in its historical state,
                            is a working
                            restaurant. The mosque and hammam or public baths are closed to the public, although
                            visitors can peer
                            through their glass windows or marble latticework. Walkways are crumbling, and public

                            at the entrance and inside the park. The Lahori Gate entrance leads to a mall with jewellery
                            and craft
                            stores. There is also a museum of "blood paintings", depicting young 20th-century Indian
                            martyrs and their
                            stories, an archaeological museum and an Indian war-memorial museum.</p><br>

                        <p>To prevent terrorist attacks, security is especially strict around the Red Fort on the eve of
                            Indian
                            Independence Day. Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel keep a watch on neighbourhoods

                            and National Security Guard sharpshooters are deployed on high-rises near the fort. The

                            fort is a designated no-fly zone during the celebration to prevent air attacks, and safe
                            houses exist in
                            nearby areas to which the prime minister and other Indian leaders may retreat in the event

                        <br>
                        <span class="sticky"># Architecture</span><br>
                        <p>The World Heritage Convention characterises the Red Fort as representing "the zenith of
                            Mughal creativity".
                            The fort synthesises Islamic palace structure with local traditions, resulting in a
                            confluence of "Persian,
                            Timurid, and Hindu architecture". The fort served as an inspiration for later buildings and
                            gardens across
                            the Indian subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>The Red Fort has an area of 254.67 acres (103.06 ha) enclosed by 2.41 kilometres (1.50 mi) of
                            defensive
                            walls, punctuated by turrets and bastions that vary in height from 18 metres (59 ft) on the
                            river side to 33
                            metres (108 ft) on the city side. The fort is octagonal, with the north–south axis longer
                            than the east–west
                            axis. The marble, floral decorations and the fort's double domes exemplify later Mughal
                            architecture.</p>
                        <p>It showcases a high level of ornamentation, and the Kohinoor diamond was reportedly part of
                            the furnishings.
                            The fort's artwork synthesises Persian, European and Indian art, resulting in a unique
                            Shahjahani style rich
                            in form, expression and colour. Red Fort is one of the building complexes of India
                            encapsulating a long
                            period of history and its arts. Even before its 1913 commemoration as a monument of national
                            importance,
                            efforts were made to preserve it for posterity.</p>
