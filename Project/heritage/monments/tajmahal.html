    The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on
    the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal
    emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
    Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a
    guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.<br>
    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project
    for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost
    estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1
    billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by
    Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to
    reflect natural beauty and divinity.<br>
    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and
    one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of
    Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a
    year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.<br><br>
    <span>Etymology</span><br>
    Abdul Hamid Lahauri, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic:
    روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.The current name for the Taj Mahal is
    believed to be derived from the Persian تاج محل tāj mahall, meaning "crown" (tāj) "palace" (mahall).The name "Taj"
    came from the corruption of the second syllable of "Mumtaz".<br><br>
    <span>Inspiration</span><br>
    The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died
    on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.Construction started in
    1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five
    years later.The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the
    love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.<br><br>
    <span>Architecture and design</span><br>
    The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture.
    Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur,
    progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and
    hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah
    Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah
    Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new
    levels of refinement.<br><br>
    <span>Construction</span>
    The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja
    Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[43] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares
    (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank
    level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead
    of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous
    that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.<br>
    The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were
    used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were
    used.The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and
    crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from
    Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the
    white marble.<br>
    According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it
    was dismantled by peasants overnight.A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and
    materials to the construction site and teams of 20 or 30 oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.An
    elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from
    the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to
    a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.<br>
    The plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years
    and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages,
    discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on "completion". Construction of the mausoleum
    itself was essentially completed by 1643 while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the
    cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been
    estimated to be about ₹ 32 million, which is around ₹ 52.8 billion ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.<br>
